# Platform Workgroup

## Purpose
The Platform Workgroup focuses on developing and maintaining the hosting infrastructure and launchpad for the Eliza AI ecosystem. Key areas of interest include:
- Building a decentralized hosting layer optimized for Eliza
- Integrating new projects and aligning with the DAO structure and working groups
- Exploring collaboration opportunities with external platforms and technologies

## Recent Activities
- Discussed the development of a launchpad and decentralized hosting layer for Eliza (Dec 20, 2024)
  - Considered repurposing an existing AI AVS for the hosting layer
  - Explored potential collaboration with EigenLayer's Ungate InfiniRoute app
- Prepared to present a pre-built hosting solution at the Solana AI hackathon (Dec 17, 2024)
  - Team led by @morpheAIs, with engineers experienced in cloud infrastructure development
  - Focused on aligning the DAO structure and working group integration with new projects
- Investigated hosting platform readiness for the 'Gmove' project (Dec 28, 2024)
  - Considered platforms like Vvaifus and Mee.fun
  - Discussed swarm infrastructure compatibility with non-Eliza tech agents deployed on these platforms
- Explored the potential of AI communication methods and their implementation (Dec 31, 2024)
  - Discussed the operator/goals system and its planned implementation in version 2 of a theoretical project
