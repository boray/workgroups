# Swarms Workgroup

## Purpose
The Swarms Workgroup focuses on various aspects related to swarm intelligence, multi-agent systems, and human-AI collaboration. Recent discussions and efforts include:
- Developing a full brain upload project inspired by Ray Kurzweil's ideas
- Exploring human-agent pair concepts with spendable balances and alignment testing
- Integrating personal data warehouses with tools like Obsidian, Zotero, and Screenpipe

## Recent Activities
- Discussed the development of a Ray Kurzweil-like full brain upload project (Dec 28, 2024)
  - Proposed starting the project in a public ElizaOS repo fork
  - Planned to implement Arena X Ware technology
- Explored the human-agent pair idea (Dec 31, 2024)
  - Agents would have a spendable balance and undergo pentesting for alignment evaluation
  - Emphasized personal or small group alignments with credibly neutral HQs using hub-and-spoke architecture
- Raised concern about agents not replying when mentioned or replied to on Twitter (Jan 1, 2025)
  - Highlighted the need to investigate the issue
- Inquired about obtaining DAO roles for accessing the proposals forum (Dec 28, 2024)
  - Discussed the process and requirements for obtaining the necessary roles and tokens
