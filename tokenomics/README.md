# Regen Tokenomics Workgroup

## Purpose
The Regen Tokenomics Workgroup focuses on developing and refining the tokenomics of the elizaOS ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on creating a sustainable and regenerative economic model. Key areas of discussion include:
- Designing a dual-token model for the upcoming elizaOS launchpad
- Exploring the potential of making ai16z/degenai a currency for agent-to-agent transactions
- Investigating the development of a native AI Layer 1 blockchain
- Evaluating staking and buyback mechanisms to drive value and utility for ai16z/degenai tokens

## Recent Activities
- Proposed a dual-token model for the elizaOS launchpad (Dec 29, 2024)
  - Involves Agent Tokens (AT) paired with SOL, with traded AT fees used to buy tokens for secondary liquidity
  - Discussed potential risks and benefits of the dual-pool system
- Explored the idea of Hyperliquid becoming a Layer 1 protocol (Dec 28, 2024)
  - Considered integrating swarm technology and leveraging cross-chain value through LayerZero and Wormhole
  - Focused on developing a sustainable flywheel to power Hyperliquid's dynamic utility layer
- Discussed the development of a native AI launchpad (Dec 23, 2024)
  - Aimed to generate revenue and accrue value to tokens under DAO control
  - Suggested token swaps instead of burning and involving partners in the development process
- Investigated the relationship between market cap, liquidity, and the impact of ai16z/AT pairs on token demand (Dec 30, 2024)
- Explored the potential of a currency for agent-to-agent transactions (Dec 20, 2024)
  - Considered staking to earn new agent tokens and creating an official launchpad with compulsory donations
